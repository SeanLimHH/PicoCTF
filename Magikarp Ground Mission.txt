Description:

Do you know how to move between directories and read files in the shell? Start the container, `ssh` to it, and then `ls` once connected to begin. Login via `ssh` as `ctf-player` with the password, `a13b7f9d`
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

Solution:
Based on the description, i just run ssh ctf-player@venus.picoctf.net -p 59681
Then enter the password given `a13b7f9d` and then this connects me to the virtual container in a server.

Here, i type dir. It reveals two files:

1of3.flag.txt  instructions-to-2of3.txt

Then i ran `cat 1of3.flag.txt`.

This gave me a flag, the first part:
picoCTF{xxsh_

Similarly, i ran:
cat instructions-to-2of3.txt

This gave me a hint:
Next, go to the root of all things, more succinctly `/`.
The author here probably meant for me to cd to move up to the parent directory.
So i run cd ..

It shows
3of3.flag.txt  drop-in

cat 3of3.flag.txt reveals the second part of the flag:
71be5264}

Here i realise this is not the flag, i am missing the 2nd part of the flag.

Then i try cd / on the first directory because of the hint.
This navigated me to the root directory with the 2of2.flag.txt

Running cat 2of2.flag.txt gave me the second part of the flag:
0ut_0f_\/\/4t3r_

This disconnects me in the shell from the virtual container once i ran the last command.

So the flag is picoCTF{xxsh_0ut_0f_\/\/4t3r_71be5264}.
