Description:

There is some interesting information hidden around this site http://mercury.picoctf.net:39698/. Can you find it?

Solution:

This challenge was pretty similar to one i did.

Going to the website > Right Click > Inspect > Elements. We look at the HTML.
There is the first part of the flag:

picoCTF{t

Then the second part is in the CSS code:

h4ts_4_l0

The difference from another similar exercise is this time the last part is not in the JS code.

For the JS code, there is a tiny text at the bottom that states:
/* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */

Googling this, we get:
https://www.ilfusion.com/how-to-prevent-google-from-indexing-certain-web-pages
There are four ways to tell Google not to index a page in search engines: 
1. a “noindex” metatag, 
    This we insert <meta name=”robots” content=”noindex”> at the top of the page's HTML
2. an X-Robots-Tag, 
3. a robots.txt file, 
4. and through Google Webmaster Tools.

Regarding the first step, we can follow this: https://www.appnovation.com/blog/using-chromes-local-overrides-design-and-performance-optimizations
to override the website's files with our own.
Under Sources > Right Click > Overwrite content.
Then i added and did the first way: a "noindex' metatag. Refreshing the page yields no change.

Doing step 2: https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag
We add this line: 
X-Robots-Tag: noindex to the header of the response of the URL under Networks.

Still no change.

Doing step 3: https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/create-robots-txt?hl=en&visit_id=638409600651210789-2992270977&rd=1
We access the webpage endpoint: http://mercury.picoctf.net:39698/robots.txt
The robots.txt at the end redirects to a new webpage with message:
    "
    User-agent: *
    Disallow: /index.html
    # Part 3: t_0f_pl4c
    # I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?
    "

So this is the third part of the flag.

Then the last part, something to do with apache server.

At this point. I honestly could not figure out. Google searching, it is something to do
with using .htaccess on files.

The concept of .htaccess is that it is a configuration file on web servers that run on Apache.
It stands for hypertext access.

With this clue, http://mercury.picoctf.net:39698/.htaccess provides us the next part of the flag:
3s_2_lO0k

There is a textual hint below for the next flag:
# I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.

Google searching which file in mac stores file information, we get that the .DS_Store file stores
custom attributes of its containing folder.

Doing the same thing; accessing webpage endpoint http://mercury.picoctf.net:39698/.DS_Store
provides us with the final part of the flag:
_fa04427c}

Combining all parts of the flag, we get:
picoCTF{th4ts_4_l0t_0f_pl4c3s_2_lO0k_fa04427c}
