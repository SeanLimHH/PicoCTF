Description:

Using tabcomplete in the Terminal will add years to your life, esp. 
when dealing with long rambling directory structures and filenames: 
Addadshashanammu.zip


The attached file contains a lot of nested folders. In the deepest folder,
we see a file with no extension: fang-of-haynekhtnamet

Solution:

tabcomplete: did not yield results. So i think the author meant just using tab.

I think the author is testing for familiarity with the terminal.
The flag should be in the last file.

Googling search how to open zip in Bash, we get:
https://askubuntu.com/questions/86849/how-to-unzip-a-zip-file-from-the-terminal

So i ran:
unzip Addadshashanammu.zip and it extracted to a folder called 'Addadshashanammu'

I can cd all the way to the file, but i think this is not the intended approach.

So Googling for ways to quickly enter nested directories, i see no related tricks...

Then so i try cd and tab. But it does nothing.
Then i try cd Addadshashanammu and try to tab. This time, it appends a slash and the folder within it.

This works and hence is probably what was intended.

Here then i navigate to the final and only file.

From information.txt, i learnt to run binwalk on the file to gather description.
I call binwalk fang-of-haynekhtnamet and it returns me an ELF file.

This, from Static ain't always noise.txt, i see that it is an object file.
From here, then i call binwalk -W fang-of-haynekhtnamet to view the contents of the file in hexadecimal
and then you can see the flag within the contents:

0x000006E0  01 00 02 00 00 00 00 00 2A 5A 41 50 21 2A 20 70 |........*ZAP!*.p|
0x000006F0  69 63 6F 43 54 46 7B 6C 33 76 33 6C 5F 75 70 21 |icoCTF{l3v3l_up!|
0x00000700  5F 74 34 6B 33 5F 34 5F 72 33 35 74 21 5F 32 62 |_t4k3_4_r35t!_2b|
0x00000710  63 66 62 32 61 62 7D 00 01 1B 03 3B 3C 00 00 00 |cfb2ab}....;<...|

So the flag is picoCTF{l3v3l_up!_t4k3_4_r35t!_2bcfb2ab} which is the solution.
