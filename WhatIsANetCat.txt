Using netcat (nc) is going to be pretty important. Can you connect to jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org at port 41120 to get the flag?

Solution:
The syntax i found online was:

nc <ipaddress> <port>

So the answer is nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 41120

netcat is a utility that operates in the layer that consists of UDP and TCP (Transport layer)

netcat can be used to test the connection. In this challenge, it is teaching the syntax of connecting to the server and the port.
