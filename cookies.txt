Description:

Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one.
http://mercury.picoctf.net:29649/

This website just shows a search bar with hint text = "snickerdoodle"

Solution:

Right-clicking > Application > Cookies > we see just a row:
name = "name", value = -1, ...

If we type the hint text = "snickerdoodle", we get instead:

The page says "That is a cookie! Not very special though..."
And the search bar disappears, replaced with a text:
"I love snickerdoodle cookies!"

The cookies also changed to 0.

Apart from this, there is not much interesting activity in this cookies section.

Looking at the Network tab, we see:

A few GET requests:

'search' :

This is when i input the snickerdoodle hint text.

When we do a random input, we get:

Cookie

There is no pattern here...

Here, i notice that the only clue left is with is the 1 or 0 response.

Something to do with cookies.. so i change the value of cookie to -2 and refresh the page.

No change, but also no error.
So i try changing the value to 2 and refresh the page.

Then the page changed to 'I love oatmeal raisin cookies!'.

This suggests, possibly, that the cookie value redirects to a different page in the server.

So here i just play around with the values, increasing it one by one to iterate through all the cookies.

Cookie 18 reveals the flag:

Regarding how the challenge was built:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/cookie

After having a server, in the client-side code, obtain the cookies via document.cookie.
Then based on this cookie, respond with a different message. This is what the webpage is doing.

So the issue here is that the client-side code is reading off the client's data that can be manipulated.
In this case, the user, myself, can intentionally change the cookie values and thereby make use of this flaw,
to trick the server to thinking that i have proper rights to the cookie (webpage message).

A few solutions to this problem:
1. Encrypt this value.
By encrypting this value both in the server and client-side, it is much harder to guess and figure out the cookie values.
2. The above point 1. may be inadequate if the user somehow guess 1 2 3 ...
It is better to use a random numbers or even hashes of the random numbers, in place of 1, 2, 3 of the cookie values.
This coupled with 1. will ensure that the cookies are not easily revealed.
